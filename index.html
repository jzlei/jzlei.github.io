<h1>Welcome</h1>
	
	<p>This is my academic website, where you can find information on my current research and the classes that I teach. I am currently an assistant professor in the <a href="http://www.clemson.edu/cbbs/departments/political-science/">Department of Political Science</a> at <a href="http://www.clemson.edu/">Clemson University</a> and a <a href="https://www.bitss.org/people/steven-miller/">BITSS Catalyst</a> with the <a href="https://www.bitss.org">Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences</a>.</p>

	<p>My research and teaching interests focus on the broad intersection of international conflict and political behavior. My current research agenda explores how external threats (e.g. terrorism and disputed territory) change individual-level political attitudes to favor autocratic governance and belligerent foreign policies. I have published over 10 articles since 2012 in peer-reviewed journals like <em>Comparative Political Studies</em>, <em>International Studies Quarterly</em>, <em>Journal of Conflict Resolution</em>, <em>Journal of Peace Research</em>, <em>Political Behavior</em>, and <em>Political Research Quarterly</em>. More recent research is funded by the National Science Foundation and has even been highlighted in newspapers like <em>The New York Times</em> and <em>The Washington Post</em>.</p>
